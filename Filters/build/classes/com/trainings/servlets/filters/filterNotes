Filters
1. A filter is a Java class that can intercept the request and response cycles of a servlet 
2. Any logic that we want to execute before the servlet request is processed by the servlet can 
   be placed in the filter (this is the pre-processing logic)
3. Any logic that we want to execute after it has been processed by the servlet but before it 
   goes back to the web client can also be placed in the filter (post-processing logic)
4. Example: injection attack filter that is used to prevent injection attacks. If a hacker sends 
   a script or string in the request that can crash the program, we can search for those strings 
   in the filter and reject the request if the request has such strings 
5. Filter chaining - applying more than one filter to a servlet or jsp (i.e one filter doing 
   encrypting/decrypting, a second filter doing zipping and unzipping of reqest and response)
