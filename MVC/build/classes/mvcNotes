MVC Design Pattern
1. A design pattern that splits the web layer into three parts
	a. model (Java class)- represents the current state of the application
		1. holds the business logic
		2. connects to the database and performs CRUD operations
	b. view (HTML, JSP) - responsible for displaying the current model to the end user
		1. will generate an html output and send back to the web browser
	c. controller (Servlet) - the glue that holds together the model and view
		1. responsible for selecting the appropriate model to serve the appropriate request
		2. interacts with both the view and model as needed 

How MVC Design Pattern Works
1. We get request from the View (HTML)
2. The View talks to the Controller (Java servlet)
3. The Controller talks to the Model (Java  class)
4. The Model talks to the Controller
5. The Controller talks to the View (JSP)

2 Advantages to using the MVC Design Pattern
1. Maintenance 
	a. because the responsibilities are split up into various components, we can more 
	easily pinpoint and fix any issues that come up
2. Parallel Development 
	b. work can be done on each component simultaneously without tripping over each other
