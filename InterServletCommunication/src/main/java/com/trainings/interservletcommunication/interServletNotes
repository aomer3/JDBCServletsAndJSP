Inter-Servlet Communication 
1. Done using RequestDispatcher
2. Two ways request dispatcher can be done
	a. Method 1 - forward method: request comes from client, servlet 1 handles that requests 
	   and then forwards the request to servlet 2 for it to complete more work. Once the last 
	   servlet completes its job, it will send the response back to the client
	b. Method 2 - include method: request comes from client, servlet 1 handles the request and 
	   then uses include on servlet 2 for the additional work remaining, then the container 
	   combines both reponses from servlet 1 and servlet 2 and sends it back to the client. The 
	   difference is that the control never goes to servlet 2 but all the work is merged instead 
	   to create the response to send back the client
