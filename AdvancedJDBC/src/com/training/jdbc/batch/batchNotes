JDBC Batch Updates
1. If we are executing multiple DML statements from the JDBC client through the driver 
   against the database, each time we execute a statement, there is a separate call made 
   to the database. All of these calls are a performance overhead. Each time we send a 
   statement, there is network latency. 
2. JDBC Batch Updates address this issue of making multiple calls from the client to the 
   database
3. With JDBC Batch Updates, we can group a set of DML statements and send them all at 
   once through the driver and to the database 

2 Steps to batching 
1. Add the dml statements to the batch (i.e. stmt.addBatch(String dml);)
2. Execute the batch (i.e. int result[] = stmt.executeBatch();)
