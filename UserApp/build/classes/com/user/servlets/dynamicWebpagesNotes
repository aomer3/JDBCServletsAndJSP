Dynamic Web Apps
1. The HTTP protocol supports several methods in which a client can access a web server 
	a. GET method
		1. default method used if no method is specified, GET method will be used
		2. GET is used in 3 cases: when typing in a URL, when clicking a hyperlink, default method 		   when submitting a form
		3. GET is meant to be used for when you're retrieving information 
		4. GET method only has header fields, and doesn't have a body
		5. The data in the GET method goes through the URL
		6. Sensitive information like credit card numbers and passwords should never be sent through GET
		7. Since it's being sent through the URL, GET has a restriction on the length of data being sent
		8. GET is idempotent - no matter how many GET requests are run, because you are only ever reading 
   	           data from the database, it will not change the state of the database
	b. POST method
		1. POST method will never be used unless it is explicitly specified as the method to use
		2. POST method is used when explicitly specified in a form
		3. POST is meant to be used when you are modifying data (insert, update, delete)
		4. POST method has header fields and a body
		5. The data in the POST method goes through the POST body
		6. Sensitive information should be sent through POST
		7. POST has no restriction on the length of data being sent
		8. Each time POST is sent, it will change the database
