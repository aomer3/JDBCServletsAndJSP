Statement Notes:
1. When using statements, each statement (read, insert, update or delete) is 
   sent through the driver and to the database one statement at a time. The 
   database then compiles each statement one at a time, and executes each 
   statement one at a time. 
2. This constant compilation for each statement degrades the performance of the 
   application. 

Prepared Statements
1. Child interface of the Statement interface 
2. Instead of compiling one statement at a time, a PreparedStatement will compile
   and execute an entire query at once
3. PreparedStatements increase the performance of the program
