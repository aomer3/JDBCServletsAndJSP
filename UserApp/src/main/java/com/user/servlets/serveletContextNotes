Servlet Context Notes:
1. Servlet Context - interface in the Servlet API 
2. Servlet containter implements this interface and creates the servlet context
3. There is one servlet context for the entire application
4. The servlet context is destroyed when undeploy our application from the container
5. Data stored in the servlet context is global and can be shared anywhere in the 
   application 
6. During the initialization phase, the server container injects the servlet context
   into the servlet so that the servlet can use the data in the servlet context
7. Servlet context can be passed in as a paramter in the init() method, or it can
   be called using ServletContext context = getServletContext(); either in the 
   init() or service()


4 Uses of Servlet Context:
1. Share and manipulate data  
2. To deal with context params
3. To create RequestDispatcher object for inter-servlet communication 
4. To store information into the server log files using the log method (rarely used,
   usually will use easier to work with third party applications like log4j)
   
   
Context Paramters
1. Conext paramters - name-value pairs of textual information in that is supplied by the web.xml 
   configuration file for the applicaton. 
2. Similar to init paramters but difference is that init parameters are only available 
   for a particular servlet, whereas context paramters are available throughout the
   entire applications and accessible by all servlets and jsp files 
   supplied to the ser
