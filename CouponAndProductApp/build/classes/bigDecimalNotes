BigDecimalNotes
1. In databases, the data type can be decimal
2. To accurately represent the database decimal in Java, you use BigDecimal
3. Advantage of using BigDecimal: it will not round numbers in the database, will 
   return the exact value to the Java program. Must use when dealing with very sensitive
   data like money, etc. that would create issues if rounded. 
4. Disadvantage of using BigDecimal: it is slower than Double, and in most cases,
   would be an overkill to use. If decimals can be rounded without issue, it's best to 
   use Double instead
