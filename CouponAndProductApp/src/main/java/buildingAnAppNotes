Building an app notes (using JDBC, Servlets, JSPs)

Steps to build an app:
1. Create tables in MySQL

2. Create models to represent those database tables in Java
	a. place these models in their own package (.model package)
	
3. Connect to database (can use connection pooling here to increase efficiency)
	a. place this database connection in its own package (.util package)
	
4. Create the necessary CRUD methods in the DAO classes as per project requirements
	a. place all the DAO classes in their own package (.dao package)
	
5. Create all of the Views for the application 
	a. these will be .html and .jsp files
	
6. Create controllers that will take user request from Views and link them with the DAOs
	a. place all controllers in their own package (.controller package)
